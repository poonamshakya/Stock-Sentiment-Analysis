In this project we are predicting whether the stock price will increase or decrease. Model is trained on the dataset of news headlines.
## Dataset
we are using dataset provided by kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews
## Feature vector
We are creating feature vector using count vectorizer and TFidf Vectorizer.
## Algorithm
We are using Random Forest algorithm and Naive Bayes.
## Accuracy
 Random Forest with feature extracted using count Vectorizer: 86% 
 Random Forest with feature extracted using Tfidf Vectrorizer: 79%
 Naive Bayes with feature extracted using count Vectorizer: 85%
